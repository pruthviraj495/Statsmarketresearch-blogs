 <p>The brake fluid pressure sensor senses the brake fluid pressure in the hydraulic brake system. The sensor is a pressure switch that can display and warn of faults in the braking system. The brake fluid pressure sensor is used for the anti-lock brake system (ABS). The wheels lock unexpectedly when the ABS system fault light is on, but it may also include insufficient fluid level in the reservoir.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The new accident avoidance technology system also uses the brake fluid pressure sensor.</p>
