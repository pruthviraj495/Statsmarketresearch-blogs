 <p>Disc drum brake is a braking system that combines disc brake and drum brake on a vehicle. This type of braking system is usually used for light trucks, SUVs and some passenger cars. The front brake of the disc drum brake system consists of the disc brake, and the rear brake consists of the drum brake. The disc brake is usually larger and stronger than the drum brake, which helps to provide better braking force and reduce the risk of brake fading during heavy braking.</p>
