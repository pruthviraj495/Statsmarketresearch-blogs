 <p>The stepper motor used for headlamp rotation is a motor used for automobile headlamp system, which is used to rotate the headlamp in different directions. These motors are usually used for vehicles equipped with adaptive or dynamic headlights, which can rotate and adjust the beam direction according to the driving conditions. Stepping motor is a kind of motor that converts electric pulse into precise mechanical motion. It works by rotating the axis in small and precise steps, each step corresponding to a specific rotation angle. This makes it very suitable for applications requiring precise control of movement, such as headlamp rotation. In the headlamp system, the stepper motor is used to control the position of the headlamp. This allows the headlamp to rotate and adjust its beam direction to provide the best view when driving. The motor receives signals from the vehicle control system, which tells it how far to turn the headlamp in all directions.</p>
