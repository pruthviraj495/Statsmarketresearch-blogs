 <p>The fuel temperature sensor (FTS) is designed to monitor the temperature of the vehicle&#39;s fuel and transmit this information to the engine control unit, which can then optimize the air-fuel mixture ratio according to the fuel temperature relative to the intake air temperature. The sensor enables the vehicle to operate at maximum efficiency regardless of the external temperature. The more efficient the combustion process is, the less pollutants are emitted through the exhaust system.</p>
