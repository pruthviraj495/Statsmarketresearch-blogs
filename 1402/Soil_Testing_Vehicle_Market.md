 <p>Mobile Soil Testing Lab is mainly used to judge the soil pollution status, and forecast the development trend. To determine the source, <strong>scope</strong> and extent of pollution and provide scientific basis for administrative departments to take countermeasures. Make full use of land purification capacity, prevent soil pollution, protect soil ecological environment. By analyzing and measuring the content of some elements in soil, the background value level and change of these elements were determined, and the abundance, shortage and supply of elements were understood, which provided the basis for the protection of soil ecological environment, the rational application of trace elements and the discussion and prevention of local etiology. Monitoring categories include soil monitoring, sludge monitoring, Marine sediment monitoring, solid waste monitoring pollution-free products, green food origin environmental certification monitoring, farmland soil heavy metals and other environmental monitoring, construction projects environmental soil evaluation, etc.</p>
