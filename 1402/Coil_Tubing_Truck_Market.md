 <p>Coil Tubing Truck has the characteristics of pressure operation and continuous tripping, small size of equipment, fast operation cycle and low cost. Despite these advantages, coiled tubing was not widely used in its early days due to the limitations of manufacturing process and equipment. After decades of development, various technologies have been quite mature at present, coiled tubing has been widely used in various oilfield operations. In general, domestic coiled tubing operators are mainly used in: sand washing, bridge plug drilling, gas lift, liquid nitrogen injection, wax removal, liquid drainage, acid extrusion, logging, etc. In recent years, it is also widely used in fracturing shale gas and coalbed methane Wells. Coiled tubing drilling is also widely used abroad.</p>
