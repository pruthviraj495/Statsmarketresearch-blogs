 <p>The fuel cell engine of heavy trucks is a power system that uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity to provide power for heavy trucks. This is a zero-emission technology that has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. The working principle of fuel cell engine is to combine hydrogen fuel with oxygen in the air to produce electricity, heat and water vapor as by-products. The generated electricity is then used to drive the motor that drives the truck wheels.</p>
