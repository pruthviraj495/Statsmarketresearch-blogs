<h1>ADAS Millimeter Wave Radar Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) Millimeter Wave Radar refers to the sensor technology that plays a pivotal role in enhancing the safety and driving experience of modern vehicles. Operating within the millimeter-wave frequency range (typically between 24GHz and 77GHz), this radar uses electromagnetic waves to detect and measure the distance, speed, and angle of objects surrounding a vehicle.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>The technology aids in critical ADAS functions such as automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, and collision avoidance. A significant advantage of millimeter-wave radar is its reliability in harsh weather conditions such as fog, rain, or snow. This makes it an essential component in ensuring vehicle safety even in challenging environments.</p>
