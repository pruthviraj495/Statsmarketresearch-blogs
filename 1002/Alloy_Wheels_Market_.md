<h1>Alloy Wheels Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The global alloy wheels market revolves around the manufacturing and distribution of wheels made from metal alloys, primarily aluminum and magnesium. Alloy wheels are favored over traditional steel wheels due to their lighter weight, superior heat conduction, and aesthetic appeal. These characteristics contribute to improved vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and enhanced handling. Due to their lightweight nature, alloy wheels are predominantly used in passenger vehicles rather than commercial vehicles, which require higher load-bearing capacity.</p>
