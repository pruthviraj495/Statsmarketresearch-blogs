<h1>Hydrogen Fuel Vehicle Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>Hydrogen fuel vehicle is a mobile vehicle with hydrogen as the main energy. Ordinary internal combustion engines are usually injected with diesel or gasoline, while hydrogen vehicles use gaseous hydrogen instead. Fuel cell and electric motor will replace the general engine. The principle of hydrogen fuel cell is to put hydrogen into the fuel cell. The electrons of hydrogen atom are blocked by proton exchange membrane, and transmitted from the negative pole to the positive pole through external circuit to drive electric motor; However, protons can be combined with oxygen through proton exchange membrane to form pure water mist.</p>
