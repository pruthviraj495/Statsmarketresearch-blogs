<h1>Light Diesel Vehicle Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>With the rising fuel prices as a result of increasing demand and diminishing supply, there has been rise in the need to choose a cost effective fuel for vehicles. Despite its higher price than gasoline, diesel proves to be highly efficient and cost effective. In addition, diesel enables extraction of more energy as compared to same volume of gasoline. Furthermore, diesel has a higher boiling point and is oilier than gasoline which improves engine efficiency. Thereby, diesel has become a preferred choice for both heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles across the world. Moreover, light diesel vehicles have reduced carbon emissions as compared to similar gasoline powered vehicles.</p>
