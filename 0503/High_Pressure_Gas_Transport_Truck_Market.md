 <p>The structure of the high-pressure gas transport truck is the front part and the trailer part. The former provides power, and the latter mainly provides storage space. It consists of 6-12 high-pressure storage cylinders with a pressure of 20-52Mpa and a length of about 10m. The cylinders pass through the frame and travel. The device is connected or directly fixed with the walking device, connected by valves and pipelines, and the head of the trailer can be separated from the trailer after reaching the refueling station. The transportation technology is mature, and the specifications are relatively complete. Currently, hydrogen refueling stations mostly use this method. transportation. Taking high-pressure hydrogen as an example, due to the small density of hydrogen and the heavy weight of the hydrogen storage container, the weight of the transported hydrogen only accounts for 1-2% of the total transport weight. Therefore, the long-tube trailer for hydrogen transportation is only suitable for scenarios with a short transportation distance (transportation radius of 200 kilometers) and a low transportation volume. To ensure the hydrogen supply, the number of trailers required by the hydrogen refueling station increases correspondingly with the increase of the distance: when the distance is less than 50km, only one trailer can meet the hydrogen supply of the day, and 2 trailers are required for the distance of 50~300km. After 300km, 3 trailers are required. The working process is as follows: the purified product hydrogen is compressed to 20MPa by the compressor, loaded into the long-tube trailer through the gas column, and transported to the destination, the hydrogen-loaded tube bundle is separated from the front of the car, and the gas column is discharged through the unloading column and pressure regulation. The hydrogen in the tube bundle is discharged into the high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure hydrogen storage tanks of the hydrogen refueling station for hierarchical storage. The transport efficiency of this method is low. Domestic standards stipulate that the nominal working pressure of long-tube trailer gas cylinders is 10-30MPa, and the gas cylinders for transporting hydrogen are mostly 20MPa. Take the TT11-2140-H2-20-I type container bundle box produced by NK Aether as an example. Its working pressure is 20MPa, and the volume of hydrogen that can be filled each time is 4164Nm3 and the mass is 347kg. The total mass after loading is 33168kg. Transport efficiency 1.06%.</p>
