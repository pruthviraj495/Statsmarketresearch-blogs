<h1>Automotive Wireless Power Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p><strong>The global Automotive Wireless Power market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong> Wireless power transfer (WPT), wireless power transmission, wireless energy transmission (WET), or electromagnetic power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power from a power source, generates a time-varying electromagnetic field, which transmits power across space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load. The technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thus increasing the mobility, convenience, and safety of an electronic device for all users. Wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Automotive Wireless Power, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Automotive Wireless Power.
