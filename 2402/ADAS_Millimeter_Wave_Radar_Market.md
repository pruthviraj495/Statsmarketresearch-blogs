<h1>ADAS Millimeter Wave Radar Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) Millimeter Wave Radar refers to the sensor technology that plays a pivotal role in enhancing the safety and driving experience of modern vehicles. Operating within the millimeter-wave frequency range (typically between 24GHz and 77GHz), this radar uses electromagnetic waves to detect and measure the distance, speed, and angle of objects surrounding a vehicle.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The technology aids in critical ADAS functions such as automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, and collision avoidance. A significant advantage of millimeter-wave radar is its reliability in harsh weather conditions such as fog, rain, or snow. This makes it an essential component in ensuring vehicle safety even in challenging environments.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global ADAS Millimeter Wave Radar market was valued at USD 10.36 billion in 2024 and the global market is projected to reach USD 25.83? billion</strong>? <strong>by 2032</strong>? <strong>is forecasted to expand at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 12.10% from 2025 to 2032. </strong></p>
