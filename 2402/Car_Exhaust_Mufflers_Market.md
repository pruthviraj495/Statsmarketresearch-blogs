<h1>Car Exhaust Mufflers Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Car exhaust mufflers are essential components of a vehicle&#39;s exhaust system, designed to minimize noise produced by engine combustion and control emissions. Located at the rear bottom of the vehicle, mufflers work by redirecting and dampening sound waves through a series of chambers or perforated tubes, ensuring a quieter and more environmentally friendly driving experience. Mufflers are broadly classified into two types: absorptive mufflers, which use sound-absorbing materials, and reactive mufflers, which alter sound waves through reflection and interference.</p>
