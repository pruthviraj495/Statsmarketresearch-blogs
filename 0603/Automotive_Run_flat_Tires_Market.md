 <p>Run-flat tires provide enhanced safety and convenience and minimize the risk of on-road collision and accidents. In cases of deflation, run-flat tires stabilize the vehicle from losing its intended path and allows it to be run for a distance of about 80 to 100 miles at low speed. As they do not require a spare tire and a tire changing kit or tool, run-flat tires also help in reducing the vehicle?s overall weight. The use of advanced technologies and superior materials will further boost the popularity of run-flat tires.</p>
