<h1>Amphibious Cars Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Amphibious cars have been conceived from ca. 1900, however the Second World War significantly stimulated their development. Two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during World War II. The most proliferous was the German Schwimmwagen, a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the Porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in World War II. The amphibious bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, the firm&#39;s body construction designer, using the engine and drive train of the K?belwagen. An amphibious version of the Willys MB jeep, the Ford GPA or &#39;Seep&#39; (short for Sea jeep) was developed during World War II as well. A specially modified GPA, called Half-Safe, was driven and sailed around the world by Australian Ben Carlin in the 1950s.</p>
