<h1>Automotive Compressed Air Brake System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>The compressed air brake system is a kind of friction brake for automobiles. Compressed air is utilized for activating a piston, which applies the required pressure on the brake pad that helps to stop the vehicle. The compressed air braking system is a high power braking system, which is more commonly employed in heavy vehicles, primarily for vehicles that have multiple trailers, such as buses, semi-trailers, trucks, and trailers. Humans are unlikely to generate the amount of braking force required to stop a heavy load vehicle. Hence, another power source is required that can be utilized to produce the braking force required to apply pressure on the braking pads and subsequently, decelerate the vehicle.</p>
