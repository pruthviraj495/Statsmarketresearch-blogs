<h1>Automotive Gasoline EGR System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>EGR system is considered one of the most reliable technologies among various NOx and CO2 emission reduction techniques used in the automotive industry. All the major automakers are incorporating downsized engines to meet the stringent emission regulations imposed by regulatory authorities as well as to rely on customer demand for higher-performance vehicles. The downsized engine generally uses a turbocharger, which increases the density and temperature of the air in the air intake manifold. EGR systems play a vital role in diverting the exhaust gas back to the engine?s intake. Some of the key advantages of the EGR system in gasoline engines are reduced throttling lose, reduced heat rejection, and reduced chemical dissociation. It also reduces the knock limit by a higher compression ratio, providing better fuel economy.</p>
