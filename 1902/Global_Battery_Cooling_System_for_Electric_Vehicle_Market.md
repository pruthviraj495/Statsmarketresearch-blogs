<h1>Global Battery Cooling System for Electric Vehicle Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p><strong>The Global Battery Cooling System for Electric Vehicle Market Size was estimated at USD 947.60 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 3345.91 million by 2029, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 23.40% during the forecast period.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong>:</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The optimal operating temperature range of the power battery is about 20-30C. At low temperature, the battery capacity is low, and the charge and discharge performance is poor; at high temperature, the battery cycle life will be shortened, and safety problems such as explosion may even occur at high temperature. Multiple battery cells form a battery pack in series and parallel mode, and the heat generated during charging and discharging affects each other. Keeping the power battery pack to work within a reasonable temperature range requires a sophisticated electric vehicle battery cooling system. The main components of the electric vehicle battery cooling system are a cooling plate, a cooler, an electronic water pump, and an electronic expansion valve.</p>
