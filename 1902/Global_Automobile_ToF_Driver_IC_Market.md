 <p><strong>Report Overview:</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>ToF (Time-of-Flight) is a 3D sensing technology that calculates the distance and depth between objects by measuring the time of flight of light. It is a technology that recognizes the three-dimensional effect, spatial information and motion of an object by calculating the distance to the object after measuring the time of the reflected signal by sending infrared wavelengths to the object, so it is applied to Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The ToF sensor must be driven with a Driver IC. In automotive applications, ToF can be used for autonomous driving, collision avoidance automatic braking, and OOP as depth ranging, such as lidar and smart cameras.</p>
