 <p>The increasing congestion and pollution in the cities are leading to the adoption of bicycles because they are cheap, environment-friendly, healthy, and traffic-reducing mode of transport. Fuel prices have increased significantly in the past few years and continue to fluctuate. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average price per barrel of crude oil was $43/b in 2016. The rise in fuel prices has resulted in the increase in the adoption of electric bicycles and pedelecs as a daily mode of transport. With the rise in fuel prices, the demand for battery-powered bicycles has increased. Bicycles are equipped with motors, which help manage speeds better and make them easier to drive through mountain areas, overpasses, and rough roads. Inclination toward crank motor in electric bicycles is one of the key trends contributing towards the bicycle motors market. To gain higher performance capacity and suitability of uphill rides, the new generation electric bicycles are incorporating crank motors. APAC is expected to be the major revenue contributor to the bicycle motors market throughout the forecast period. One of the major reason for the growth of this market in this region is the increasing adoption of electric bicycles in China.</p>
