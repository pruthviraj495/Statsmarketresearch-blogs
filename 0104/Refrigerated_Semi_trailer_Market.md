<h1>Refrigerated Semi-trailer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight is supported by a tractor unit, a detachable front axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>A semi-trailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Semi-Trailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi&#39;s chief advantages.</p>
