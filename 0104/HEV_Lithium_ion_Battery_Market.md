<h1>HEV Lithium-ion Battery Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) combine the benefits of gasoline engines and electric motors and can be configured to meet different objectives such as improved fuel economy, increased power, or additional auxiliary power for electronic devices and power tools.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>HEVs run on fuel alone and do not plug in to an electrical outlet to recharge the battery.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>A battery with high capacity is indispensable for improving acceleration and fuel efficiency for hybrid vehicles. This hybrid Li-ion battery delivers higher power compared to similarly sized conventional cells. As the output of the battery increases, so too does the acceleration. It also more efficiently stores energy during deceleration, further improving fuel efficiency.</p>
