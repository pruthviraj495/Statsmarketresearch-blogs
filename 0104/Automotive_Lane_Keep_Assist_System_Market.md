<h1>Automotive Lane Keep Assist System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Lane keep assist system is an active safety system, which detects lane markings on the road with cameras or sensors and assists the driver to keep the vehicle within the lane. This is done either by providing a warning through a buzzer, or seat vibration, or a similar indication, or by automatically steering the vehicle when it departs the lane. If a vehicle departs its lane, the possibility of freak accidents are fairly common in hilly terrain or steep terrain owing to the curving roads and complexities of driving. This is likely to cause severe damage to both the motorist and vehicle. It can be handled through incorporation of lane keep assist system in the vehicle.</p>
