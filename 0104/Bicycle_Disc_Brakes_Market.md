<h1>Bicycle Disc Brakes Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Disc brakes are a powerful and progressive braking mechanism; a hydraulic or cable actuated caliper forces the disc brake pads onto a rotor to slow down or stop your bike.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The vast majority of disc brakes on mountain bikes are hydraulically activated; brake fluid drives pressure to the caliper and this results in a clamping force on your rotor via the brake pads. The physical act of braking is caused by the friction generated by the brake pads and the rotors. Hydraulic disc brakes are lighter, more reliable, feel better and are more powerful than cable actuated disc brakes. Cable discs however are cheaper and if you already have a bike with cable rim brakes, you don?t need to buy new brake levers as a cable disc brake will use conventional-style cable pull brakes.</p>
