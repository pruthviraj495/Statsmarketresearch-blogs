<h1>Commercial Vehicle Ignition Coil Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>An?ignition coil?(also called a?spark coil) is an?induction coil?in an?automobile&#39;s?ignition system?that?transforms?the?battery&#39;s?low voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an?electric spark?in the?spark plugs?to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car&#39;s 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the ignition coil to the?distributor?and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or?high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical?contact breaker?points and a?capacitor?(condenser). More recent electronic?ignition systems?use a?power transistor?to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a?distributor?to route the high voltage pulses.</p>
