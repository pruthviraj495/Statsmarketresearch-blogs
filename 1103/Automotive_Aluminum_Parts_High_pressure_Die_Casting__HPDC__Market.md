<h1>Automotive Aluminum Parts High-pressure Die Casting (HPDC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>High-pressure die casting (HPDC) is a very commonly used process for creating structural components, especially in Mg. In this process, a metal die having a cavity with the negative geometry of the part is created; simple dies usually consist of two matching halves, while more complex dies can add sliding features that create holes and undercut areas. The die is mounted onto a machine capable of injecting molten metal at high velocities. The die cavity is closed, molten metal is poured into a shot sleeve, the sleeve opening is closed, and a ram moves forward to force the metal into the die in a very short time (10?100 ms), generating high levels of applied pressure. Following this, the ram pressure is maintained for a short time; often, active cooling occurs as internal water passages in the die are activated. Then, the pressure is released and the ram is withdrawn; the die opens and ejector pins push out part. The process cycle for the HPDC process is usually very rapid; for example, a current 110 lb HPDC V6 engine block has a process cycle time of approximately 90 seconds. The rapid speed of the HPDC yields a number of advantages. In terms of costs, HPDC creates castings with a high casting yield (up to 95%), high to very high near net shape, high levels of surface finish, and high dimensional control; all of these factors minimize the amount of post-casting machining and finishing that must be performed.</p>
