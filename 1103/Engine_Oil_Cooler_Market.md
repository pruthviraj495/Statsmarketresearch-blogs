<h1>Engine Oil Cooler Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>The purpose of the engine oil cooler is to allow the engine?s cooling system to remove excess heat from the oil. These types of coolers are usually of the water-to-oil type of heat exchanger. In most vehicles on the road, engine oil is fed to the oil coolers from an adapter that is located between the engine block and the engine oil filter. The oil then flows through the tubes of the cooler while the engine coolant flows around the tubes. The heat from the oil is transferred through the walls of the tubes to the surrounding coolant similar in many ways to the operation of an indoor air conditioning for residential homes. The heat absorbed by the engine?s cooling system is then transferred to the air as it passes through the vehicle?s radiator, which is located in front of the engine behind the grille of the vehicle.</p>
