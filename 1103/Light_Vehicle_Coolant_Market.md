<h1>Light Vehicle Coolant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Vehicle coolant, also known as antifreeze, is a liquid substance that circulates through an internal combustion engine and draws off excessive heat. The two most common chemicals used for this are ethylene and propylene glycol, both of which have lower freezing points than water (32? Fahrenheit or 0? Celsius). This allows the chemicals to flow freely even under cold winter conditions. Automotive Coolant also has a higher boiling point than pure water, which makes it ideal for summer use as well.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Light Vehicle Coolant, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Light Vehicle Coolant.
