<h1>Electric Vehicle (EV) DC Fuses Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2035</h1><br/><p>Electric Vehicle (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) fuses protect electrical circuits, electrical equipment and batteries in an electric vehicle from electrical faults such as overloads and short circuits. The electrical circuits in Electric vehicles utilise direct current (DC) voltage. EV fuses often feature 500Vdc or 1000Vdc ratings. Like regular fuses, the voltage rating of an EV fuse is the maximum voltage for which the fuse is designed to operate. It will still work correctly in voltages below the maximum voltage rating.</p>
