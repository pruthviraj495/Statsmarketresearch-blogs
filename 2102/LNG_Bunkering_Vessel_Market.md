 <p>LNG Bunkering is the practice of providing liquefied natural gas fuel to a ship for its own consumption. The key advantage of LNG as a fuel is the vast reduction in pollutant caused by the more traditional method of fueling ships such as heavy fuel oil, marine diesel fuel (MDO) and marine gas oil (MGO). LNG bunkering Vessels are used for refueling LNG-powered vessels at sea.</p>
