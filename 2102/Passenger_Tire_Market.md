<h1>Passenger Tire Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>A tire (American English) or tyre (British English; see spelling differences) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel&#39;s rim to transfer a vehicle&#39;s load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over. Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are pneumatically inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.</p>
