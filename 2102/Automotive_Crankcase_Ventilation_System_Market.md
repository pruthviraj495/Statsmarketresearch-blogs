<h1>Automotive Crankcase Ventilation System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>During the combustion process in the engine cylinders, the combustion gases, along with unburned gases, slip through the piston rings and are called as blow-by. The blow-by slips through the piston rings into the crankcase, the blow-by along with oil cause an inadmissible rise in pressure inside the crankcase, so has to be continuously removed from the crankcase. The ventilation system used for taking out or recirculating the blow-by into the engine inlet is called crankcase ventilation (CCV) system.</p>
