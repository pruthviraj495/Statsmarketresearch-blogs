<h1>Automotive Continuously Variable Transmission System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>Automotive Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) is a transmission that can change seamlessly through an infinite number of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum values. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed number of gear ratios. The flexibility of a CVT allows the input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.</p>
