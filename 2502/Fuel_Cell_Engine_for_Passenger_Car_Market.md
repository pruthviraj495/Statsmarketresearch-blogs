It combines hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity through electrochemical reaction. The generated power can then be used to drive the motor that drives the wheels of the vehicle. In passenger cars, compared with traditional internal combustion engines, fuel cell engines can provide many benefits, including: zero emissions: fuel cell engines only produce water and heat as by-products, making it a clean and environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline or diesel engines. High efficiency: compared with internal combustion engines, fuel cell engines have higher energy efficiency, which means they can obtain more energy from the same amount of fuel. Quiet operation: The fuel cell engine is much quieter than the traditional engine, and it is more comfortable and quiet to ride.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Fuel Cell Engine for Passenger Car, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Fuel Cell Engine for Passenger Car.
