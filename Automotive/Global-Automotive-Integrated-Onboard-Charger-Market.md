What Is an Automotive Integrated Onboard Charger?

An automotive integrated onboard charger (OBC) is a critical component in electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). It is responsible for converting alternating current (AC) from the external charging source into direct current (DC) to charge the vehicle’s battery. Unlike traditional external chargers, integrated onboard chargers are built directly into the vehicle’s architecture, reducing the need for external equipment and streamlining the charging process.

The development of integrated onboard chargers offers several advantages, including space savings, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced charging speed. These chargers can also support bidirectional charging, enabling the vehicle to supply power back to the grid or other devices, further enhancing their value in the electric vehicle ecosystem.
