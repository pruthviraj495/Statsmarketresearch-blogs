What is an Automotive Raindrop Sensor?

An automotive raindrop sensor is a device that detects the presence of raindrops on a vehicle's windshield. Typically, these sensors are integrated into the windshield wiper system, where they detect moisture on the glass surface and automatically activate the wipers. The sensor is often built with a nickel-coated board, forming lines that can detect the electrical resistance changes when raindrops land on the windshield.

This system ensures a safer and more convenient driving experience, especially in challenging weather conditions, by maintaining clear visibility through automatic wiper activation. Raindrop sensors are part of the broader category of vehicle safety and driver-assistance technologies, such as automatic wipers, which are increasingly being integrated into modern vehicles.
