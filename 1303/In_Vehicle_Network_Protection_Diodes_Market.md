<h1>In-Vehicle Network Protection Diodes Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>As the number of vehicles is growing so is the electric technology associated with it. But these electronic circuits are prone to surges and other related damage. To counter this problem In-vehicle diodes have been introduced. These In-vehicle diodes provide higher protection from problems such as Ele tro Static Discharge. The new devices offer properties such as low clamping voltage, low capacitance, and low leakage current. The vehicles also need protection from incorrect battery installation, the reversed polarity can damage the costly vehicle electronics. The vehicles are also prone to Electrostatic Discharge. These In-Vehicle Network protection are the emerging as solution to these problems.</p>
