 <p>The global 3D Printing In Automotive market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The primary application of 3D printers in automotive is for prototyping and tooling. Using 3D printing for prototyping reduce the turnaround time for making a prototype. Previously, manufacturers would outsource the prototyping process, which results in additional costs and increased their turnaround time. OEMs can now print a prototype overnight and at one fourth of the cost using 3D printing. Polymers are the most preferred 3D print materials because of their flexibility and strength. Metals are expected to be adopted as 3D print material in the future, as components that need to withstand high temperature and pressure can be manufactured using 3D printers with metals as print material. However, 3DP cannot be used for mass manufacturing, owing to the size constraint, and a 3D printer will not be able to print more than one object at a time</p>
