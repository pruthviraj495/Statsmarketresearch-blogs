<h1>Automobile Synchronous Belts Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automobile Synchronous Belt or Automotive Timing belt is a synthetic rubber belt, which reinforced with fiber cords. It is a ribbed belt placed in a specific configuration along one side of automobile engine to keep crank and camshafts timed properly. When the engine is on, the crankshaft converts linear energy from the pistons into rotational energy. The rotating wheel drives the timing belt and eventually the timing belt drives the two camshaft opens and closes the engine&#39;s valves to allow air and gas in and out of the engine. If the timing belt does not work well, the pistons and valves may collide, so drivers should replace timing belt regularly.</p>
