<h1>Integrated Electric Brake Booster Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Electric Brake Booster (EBB) is a brake system that?s assisted by an electric motor, and as a new approach replaces the conventional vacuum booster with a motor that works on the master cylinder plunger to add force when a driver presses the brake pedal. The booster makes hybrid and electric vehicles even more efficient, while enhancing safety through shorter braking distances. Thanks to the integrated design of the brake system, it eliminates the need for classic components such as vacuum pump, vacuum brake booster, ESP? and the related connections.</p>
