 <p>An battery sensor unit gives precise and on-demand current, voltage and temperature measurements from the battery. This information enables accurate state of charge and state of health calculations to be performed, ensuring the electrical system works at the highest level of efficiency. In addition to being able to monitor the battery, the battery sensor also helps to detect defective electronic components in the car. The sensor enhances the automobile?s diagnostic ability and can thus warn of possible breakdowns that may not even be caused by the battery. Moreover, battery sensor helps to extend battery life by 10 to 20 percent via an improved charging strategy.</p>
