<h1>Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>There are two kinds of &#39;fuels&#39; that can be used in electric cars. They&#39;re called alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The difference between AC charging and DC charging is the location where the AC power gets converted; inside or outside the car. Unlike AC chargers, a DC charger has the converter inside the charger itself. That means it can feed power directly to the car&#39;s battery and doesn&#39;t need the onboard charger to convert it. DC chargers are bigger, faster, and an exciting breakthrough when it comes to EVs.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>DC Fast Charging bypasses all of the limitations of the on-board charger and required conversion, instead providing DC power directly to the battery, charging speed has the potential to be greatly increased. Charging times are dependent on the battery size and the output of the dispenser, and other factors, but many vehicles are capable of getting an 80% charge in about or under an hour using most currently available DC fast chargers.</p>
