<h1>Automotive Transceivers Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p><strong>The global Automotive Transceivers market was valued at US$ 4268.2 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 5445.4 million by 2029, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.5% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Because of the increasing demand for data exchange in modern vehicles, the automotive industry implemented networks like CAN (Controller Area Network), LIN (Local Interconnect Network) and FlexRay protocol-based bus systems. In the future, cars will have more electronic control units (ECUs) which will feature an even higher level of functionality. Therefore, the importance of in-vehicle networking devices increases due to the larger quantity of data exchanged between the ECUs. As a result the automotive industry newly established the CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) protocol for faster CAN communication up to 5Mbit/s and CAN PN (Partial Networking) for improved energy efficiency.</p>
