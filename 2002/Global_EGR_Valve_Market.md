<h1>Global EGR Valve Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p><strong>Report Overview:</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>In internal combustion engines, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines to reduce nitrogen oxide. EGR works by recirculating a part of an engine&#39;s exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. In the case of gasoline engines, this inert exhaust displaces an amount of combustible gas from the cylinder. In diesel engines, the exhaust gas replaces parts of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture. The fuel mixture combusts, causing clatter of valves and damages the engine. Allowing small amounts of gas into the chamber reduces the temperature. Regulating the exhaust is done by the EGR Valve. EGR technology offers automobile producers a reliable, compact and cost-effective method to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, and is fast catching up the standard solution for gasoline hybrid propulsion systems. It increases the output of the fuel. The EGR Valve Minimizes throttling losses reduce chemical disassociation, reduces heat reduction.</p>
