 <p>V2X technology is based on 5.9GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication, a derivative of WiFi specifically defined for fast moving objects. It allows vehicles to communicate their state, such as their position and speed, to surrounding vehicles and infrastructures even in non-line-of-sight condition, such as behind a building or a curve.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>V2X communications shouldnt be confused with self-driving vehicles. The system has been designed to provide drivers with additional safety and convenience notifications that will be integrated with information from the many other on-board sensors. Its still up to the driver, obviously, to drive the car. However, V2X is an enabling technology that one day will make even self-driving cars much safer by helping them see and react to invisible danger.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Driver awareness of potential dangers on its way, such as crash risk, unsafe overtake, vehicle braking ahead out of line sight, car in blind spot area or road hazard detection, will dramatically improve collision avoidance, and heavily reduce fatalities and injury severity. In addition, the technology will enhance traffic efficiency providing warnings for upcoming traffic congestions, proposing alternative routes and securing an eco-friendly driving, reducing CO2 emission through adaptive cruise control and a smarter transportation management.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Driven by those benefits and the determination to become an key player in this field, ST launched a cooperation with Autotalks for the co-development of a mass-market optimized V2X chipset. Recognized as the V2X chipset market pioneer, Autotalks is bringing in this cooperation their system expertise and know-how of the V2X technology. Leveraging on a robust joint design and STs Automotive Quality and Manufacturing machine, Autotalks will release to the market an unique V2X solution.</p>
