<h1>Automotive Drive-Shaft Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive drive shaft is a mechanical part that translates the torque generated by a vehicle&#39;s engine into usable motive force to propel the vehicle. Automotive drive shaft can be divided into propeller shaft and half shaft. The propeller shaft deliver power from an engine/transmission to the other end of the vehicle before it goes to the wheels. It is used on front engine rear wheel drive and most 5-wheel drive vehicles it couples the transmission with the rear differential. There is also a pair of shorter drive shafts often used to carry torque from a transaxle to the wheels. It is used in all kinds of vehicles and the number of half shafts varied with the drive mode.</p>
