 <p>Axle shock absorber, also known as axle shock absorber, is a component of the vehicle suspension system, which helps to absorb the vibration and impact transmitted through the axle. The axle shock absorber absorbs and dissipates the impact energy by using hydraulic oil and piston. When the vehicle&#39;s axle encounters irregularities on the road, the piston of the shock absorber compresses the hydraulic oil, thus absorbing energy and slowing down the movement of the axle. When hydraulic oil flows through the piston, it is forced to pass through the small hole, which helps dissipate energy and prevent the shaft from jumping.</p>
