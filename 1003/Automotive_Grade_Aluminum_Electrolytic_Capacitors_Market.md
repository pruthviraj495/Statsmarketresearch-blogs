 <p>A capacitor is a passive electronic device used to store electrical charge. Polarized aluminum electrolytic capacitors have an anode (+) made of pure aluminum foil, an electrolyte that acts as the cathode, and a thin insulating layer of aluminum oxide that acts as the dielectric. Electrolytic capacitors have a higher capacitance-voltage (CV) product per unit volume than ceramic or film capacitors. Unlike consumer products, automobiles will run in harsh environments such as outdoors, high temperature, high cold, and humidity, and the design life is generally 15 years or 200,000 kilometers. The iteration cycle will be much higher than the 2-3 years of consumer electronics, which is harmful to the environment. , vibration, shock, reliability and consistency requirements are also high.</p>
