 <p>The fuel pump relay is a small electronic device for fuel supply in automobiles. It ensures that the pump presses the necessary amount of fuel through the nozzle at the correct time. Relay is an electronic switch controlled by electric pulse. It enables a weak surge to shut down the power circuit flowing through a relatively high current. Relays are often used for high-voltage safety maintenance. The switch controlled by electric pulse can be controlled very accurately, which makes it very practical for autonomous systems such as automobile engines. With the help of the control unit and multiple sensors, the relay can accurately control the fuel pump and optimize the engine performance and efficiency. The important data of the fuel pump control is the amount of air sucked in, the angle of the crankshaft, the required performance or the pulse of the ignition coil. The control unit calculates the necessary fuel quantity and starts the corresponding operation very accurately within a few milliseconds.</p>
