 <p>Autonomous Vehicle or driverless car or self-driving car is an advanced concept of car which reads and senses the environment to operate or drive without human input. The safety and optimum operation of the autonomous cars depends on the time taken by the input signal to reach the computer, and then the time taken by the computer to make decision. The average required time for this cycle is approximately 2 milliseconds which can be achieved through the use of 5G network. As these cars contain hundreds of sensors to make vehicle smarter but these sensors generate unprecedented amounts of data which require handling, processing, and analyzing this amount of data in order to mimic the timing of human reflexes which can be done through the high speed provided by the 5G connection.</p>
