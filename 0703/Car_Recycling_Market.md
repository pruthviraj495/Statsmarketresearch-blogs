<h1>Car Recycling Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The automobile is already one of the most effectively recovered and recycled consumer products, with its parts being used again in vehicles or for other purposes. The metals used in its manufacture are routinely recovered, reused and recycled to high levels. A major benefit of car recycling is that the steel from their parts can be reused for other purposes. This means that new ore doesn?t have to be mined and less energy is needed for the manufacture of recycled steel. This results in less air pollution, less water pollution and less mining waste, all a plus for the environment. Proper recycling of cars also safely disposes of hazardous materials from the vehicle, such as oil, coolant, brake fluid and air conditioning gases that are harmful to environment and humans.</p>
