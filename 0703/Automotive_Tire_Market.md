<h1>Automotive Tire Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive Tire is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel&#39;s rim to transfer a vehicle&#39;s load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over. Most tires are pneumatically inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tires rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.</p>
