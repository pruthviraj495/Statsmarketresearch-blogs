<h1>Pedelec Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A pedelec (from pedal electric cycle) is a bicycle where the rider&#39;s pedalling is assisted by a small electric motor; thus it is a type of low-powered e-bike. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of electric moped. Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed ? usually 25 km/h (16 mph) ? is reached.</p>
