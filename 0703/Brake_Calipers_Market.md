<h1>Brake Calipers Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Brake caliper is an essential component of disc braking system, which is one of the most common types of braking system found in cars and motorcycles. In a braking system, wheels are attached to discs or rotors, and the job of the caliper is to slow the wheels by creating friction with the rotors.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Inside each caliper is a pair of brake pads, which are like metal shoes lined with some kind of friction material. When the brake pedal is pressed, the master cylinder will force brake fluid into the caliper through a series of tubes or hoses. Then the connected pistons will push the brake pads against the rotor, creating the friction to stop or slow down the wheels. Now, with excellent performance, disk braking system is selected by most cars, especially used in the front wheels. This report brake calipers refers automotive brake calipers type, while we can also offer any product survey report related to the Brake Calipers industry chain.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The brake caliper is an integral part of the disc brake, it is responsible for the braking of the vehicle when the driver steps on the brake paddle to stop the vehicle. The brake calipers are mounted over the rotor in the disc brakes and are actuated by the piston of the brake cylinder. The size of the brake caliper varies according to the size of the disc mounted on the wheel. Brake calipers are mostly made up of semi- metallic materials in which the most common metals used are copper, brass and steel.</p>
