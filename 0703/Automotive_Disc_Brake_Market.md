<h1>Automotive Disc Brake Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Disc Brake is a type of brake that uses calipers to squeeze pairs of pads against a disc in order to create friction that retards the rotation of a shaft, such as a vehicle axle, either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary. Hydraulic disc brakes are the most commonly used form of brake for motor vehicles but the principles of a disc brake are applicable to almost any rotating shaft.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Disc Brake is usually made of cast iron, steel and aluminum, but in some cases may be made of composites such as reinforced carbon?carbon or ceramic matrix composites.</p>
