<h1>Current Sensors for Automotive Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A current sensor is?a sensor that will measure the intensity of the current flowing in electrical conductors. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV) continue to gain share in the overall global automotive market. The battery management system (BMS) for these vehicles carries out the important tasks of keeping the battery operating inside the safe operating area (SOA), monitoring power distribution, and keeping track of the state of charge (SoC). When the battery is the main source of energy for systems in HEVs/EVs, it is essential to have information about its charging and discharging cycles. Current sensors are the main source of information for charging and discharging cycle information by reporting the status of battery SOH to the battery management system. They may be located onboard or externally. For a typical battery, current sensors measure the current flowing into (when charging) or out of (when discharging) the battery.</p>
