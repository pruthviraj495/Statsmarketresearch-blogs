<h1>Automotive Thermostat Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive Thermostat is a temperature controlled on and off valve. When the temperature rises to a predetermined temperature, the thermostat opens up to allow the engine coolant to flow through the cylinder block and the radiator. This flow is crucial to maintain optimum operating temperature for fuel efficiency, enhanced drivability, and engine protection. The coolant flow is reduced when the engine is cold, and the flow is increased when the engine is hot.</p>
