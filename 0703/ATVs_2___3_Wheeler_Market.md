 <p>The global ATVs+2 & 3 Wheeler market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>India, the most important two and three wheeler market, has overtaken China to emerge as the world&#39;s biggest market for two-wheelers continued its growth trend in 2016. The massive government spending in rural programmes and large road-construction projects is leading to a pick-up in volumes in smaller towns and villages.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The market in China has been on a decline over the past few years, perhaps due to the fast-paced growth in car sales there as well as the curbs on petrol two-wheelers in top cities. China instead recorded decreasing volumes in 2016, down by 12% compared to the previous year and ending the period with nearly 16.8 million units production. The China domestic two and three wheeler industry will continue to face rising labor costs, lower market demand, more stringent price competition between enterprises. Overall, the domestic part of the city&#39;s ban on two wheeler policy will limit the consumption of the domestic motorcycle industry, but the devaluation of the renminbi and the export tax rebate rate of the motorcycle exports have played a positive impact, the motorcycle industry is entering a slow adjustment period. We forecast that China two and three wheeler market will keep a -3.87% <strong>CAGR</strong> decrease in 2016-2023F.</p>
