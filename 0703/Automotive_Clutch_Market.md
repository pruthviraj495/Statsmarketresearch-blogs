<h1>Automotive Clutch Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive clutch, located between the engine and the transmission, is an isolated part transmitting power from engine to the gearbox, and it allows transmission to be interrupted while a gear is selected to move off from a stationary position, or when gears are changed while the car is moving. An automotive clutch can help the driver enjoy a smooth start and facilitate shaft. It can also prevent the transmission overload and reduce the impact of torsional vibration.</p><p>Vehicles with manual transmissions (MT), automated manual transmissions (AMT) and dual clutch transmissions (DCT) use automotive clutches to transmit power from engine to the gearbox. However, in automatic transmissions (AT) and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) vehicles, the torque converter takes the place of the mechanical clutch to transmit power.</p><p>An automotive clutch assembly consists of many small parts, but there are five major components: the clutch flywheel, the clutch pressure plate, the clutch disc, the throw-out clutch bearing and release system.</p><p><strong>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.statsmarketresearch.com/download-free-sample/7603802/global-automotive-clutch-forecast-2023-2029-648">https://www.statsmarketresearch.com/download-free-sample/7603802/global-automotive-clutch-forecast-2023-2029-648</a></strong></p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Automotive Clutch, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Automotive Clutch.
