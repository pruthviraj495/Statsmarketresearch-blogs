<h1>Aftermarket Automotive Control Arm Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Control arm is a piece of a vehicle&#39;s suspension, it is a hinged suspension link between the chassis and the suspension upright or hub that carries the wheel. A vehicle&#39;s suspension is a complexity of geometry and leverage. The front suspensions in most vehicles manufactured today not only steer the vehicle, but also drive the vehicle. Front-wheel drive designs rely on a control arm to counteract the engine&#39;s torque. By placing an engine torque limiter arm between the engine and the vehicle&#39;s chassis, the vehicle is able to be easily steered while applying power to the engine. Without this arm, the vehicle would be nearly impossible to steer when a driver applies power to the wheels.</p>
