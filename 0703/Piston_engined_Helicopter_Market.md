<h1>Piston-engined Helicopter Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The two most common types of engines used in helicopters are the reciprocating engine and the turbine engine. Reciprocating engines, also called piston engines, are generally used in smaller helicopters. Most training helicopters use reciprocating engines because they are relatively simple and inexpensive to operate. The piston engine on a helicopter is very similar to the engine in your car. Air is sucked into the engine through a carburettor, or an air intake for the models that are fuel injected. This type of engine is a 4 stroke engine, which has 4 stages of operation. Lighter and less powerful than the Turbine Helicopter, Piston Helicopters are also less expensive to operate, and are therefore a popular choice for personal transportation, tourism and training purposes. Powered by piston engines as opposed to turbine, the leading models in this category can reach up to 350nm range.</p>
