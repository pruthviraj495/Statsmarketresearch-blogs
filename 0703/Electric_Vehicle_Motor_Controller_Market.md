<h1>Electric Vehicle Motor Controller Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The motor controller is mainly composed of heat dissipation module, power semiconductor module, control module, drive module and thin film capacitor, among which the control module includes control chip and power circuit board. The power semiconductor module mainly uses IGBT1 module. As an important signal and energy transmission component in new energy vehicles, the motor controller, on the one hand, receives information from the vehicle controller and control mechanism (brake pedal, accelerator pedal, gear shifting mechanism) to control the work of the motor, and on the other hand, converts the electric energy in the battery into the electric energy that drives the motor.The voltage and current of the driving motor are controlled by the motor controller integrated circuit, and the motor controller can make it work in accordance with the set direction, speed, Angle and response time, so as to control the starting and stopping state, advance and retreat speed, climbing strength and other driving states of the new energy vehicle.</p>
