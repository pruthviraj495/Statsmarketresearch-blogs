<h1>Automotive Torque Converter Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Automotive torque converter is a fluid coupling that functions as a means of transferring power from the engine to the transmission.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>An automotive torque converter is comprised of an impeller, turbine, stator, and front cover, these parts work in conjunction with one another to transfer power from the engine to the transmission by swirling fluid around. The impeller, which is sometimes referred to as the pump, is welded to the front cover, is not physically connected to the turbine, which drives the input shaft on the transmission. The front cover is bolted to the flex plate, and as it rotates the impeller, the increasing velocity of the transmission fluid transmits power to the turbine and transmission input shaft.</p>
