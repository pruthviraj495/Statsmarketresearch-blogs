<h1>Battery Liquid Cooling Plates For Electric Vehicle Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The core components of the Battery Thermal Management System mainly include Battery Coolers and Battery Liquid Cooling Plates. The Battery Liquid Cooling Plate is essentially a kind of radiator with a cooling water jacket embedded inside. When the cooling liquid in the cooling water jacket flows, the heat transferred from the power battery to the water-cooling plate is taken out through convection heat exchange to complete the heat dissipation effect. The Battery Liquid Cooling Plate is one of the most critical components in the liquid cooling system of the battery pack.</p>
