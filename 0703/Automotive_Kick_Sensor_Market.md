<h1>Automotive Kick Sensor Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The Automotive Kick Sensor is an intelligent electric tailgate trunk induction switch product to meet the driver&#39;s requirements for the comfort of the car. As long as walking to the trunk with the key matching the car product, and use foot to sweep the sensor position under the bar in the front and rear directions, the trunk can be opened. The main principle is that the kick sensor senses the kick action, and sends commands to the tailgate electric strut and tailgate self-priming lock through the ECU to execute the automatic opening and closing action of the tailgate. Car tailgate kick sensors can be divided into capacitive sensors and radar sensors, which can be used in SUVs and cars.</p>
