<h1>Automotive Scroll e-Compressor Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The electric compressor of automobile air conditioning is driven by motor, which is the heart of the refrigeration system of automobile air conditioning and plays the role of compressing and transporting refrigerant steam. Due to the global attention to resources and environment, countries around the world continue to promote environmentally friendly, resource-saving products preferential policies, new energy vehicles came into being. In such a big trend, the future of automotive air conditioning electric compressor industry is bright. The scroll compressor is composed of an end plate and involute scroll teeth extending from the end plate. It has many advantages. For example, the compressor is small in size and light in weight, and the eccentric shaft driving the moving turbine can rotate at a high speed. Because the scroll compressor can operates reliably without the suction valve and the exhaust valve, and it is easy to realize variable speed movement and variable displacement technology. Multiple compression chambers work simultaneously and the gas pressure difference between adjacent compression chambers is small so that the gas leakage is small. The Automotive Scroll e-Compressor market covers Below 25 cc/r, 25 - 40 cc/r, Above 40 cc/r. The typical players include DENSO, Sanden, Hanon Systems, Aotecar, Shanghai Highly, VAQOUNG, Yuebo Auto, Yinhe Electronics, etc.</p>
