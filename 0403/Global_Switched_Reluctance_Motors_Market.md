<h1>Global Switched Reluctance Motors Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Report Overview: The switched reluctance motor (SRM) is a type of a stepper motor, an electric motor that runs by reluctance torque. Unlike common DC motor types, power is delivered to windings in the stator (case) rather than the rotor. This greatly simplifies mechanical design as power does not have to be delivered to a moving part, but it complicates the electrical design as some sort of switching system needs to be used to deliver power to the different windings. With modern electronic devices, precisely timed switching is not a problem, and the SRM is a popular design for modern stepper motors. Its main drawback is torque ripple. The Global Switched Reluctance Motors Market Size was estimated at USD 581.82 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 793.16 million by 2029, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.30% during the forecast period.
