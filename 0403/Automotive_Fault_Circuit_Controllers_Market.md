 <p>High fuel costs and strict regulations on emissions have forced OEMs to generate?lighter?and?energy-efficient vehicle systems. Thereby,?the mechanical and hydraulic systems are replaced with?electrical systems,?causing the amount of electrical power carried by the vehicle?s Electrical?Wire & Interconnect System?(EWIS) to almost double. With the increase in electrical systems, the supply voltages can range from 12 to 20 V, depending on the battery charge state.?Thereby, the growing intermeshing of power systems is increasing the likelihood that the switchboards will be subjected to unacceptably high short-circuit currents. Reliable and economic protection against these surge currents is provided by the fault current limiter and this is expected to help the market grow during the forecasted period.</p>
