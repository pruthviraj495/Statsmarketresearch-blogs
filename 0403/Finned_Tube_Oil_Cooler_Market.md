Generally, light tubes are combined with a large number of through-hole cooling fins through tube expansion and other processes to form finned tubes, which greatly increases the heat transfer area and improves the heat dissipation. The area can reach 8~10 times of the light pipe. When the finned tube is working, the high-temperature hydraulic oil in the tube transfers heat to the cold air outside the tube through the tube wall and fins. The closely stacked fins outside the tube can greatly optimize the flow of air between the fins and promote the turbulence of the airflow, thereby achieving the purpose of increasing the spring heat coefficient of the air side and enhancing the heat transfer effect. This type of cooler has a simple and compact structure, small volume and mass</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Finned Tube Oil Cooler, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Finned Tube Oil Cooler.
