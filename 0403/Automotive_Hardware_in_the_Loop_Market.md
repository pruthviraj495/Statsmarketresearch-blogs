<h1>Automotive Hardware-in-the-Loop Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HIL) is a development and testing technique for real-time embedded systems Hardware-in-the-loop simulation provides dynamic system model, which can simulate real system environment, add mathematical representation of relevant dynamic system, and connect it with simulation system platform through input and output of embedded system. HIL system provides an effective platform, which can reduce the complexity of plant and control test platform HIL technology provides high quality output and reduces the cost involved and time required, so it is widely preferred in many applications (such as aerospace, automotive, etc.)</p>
