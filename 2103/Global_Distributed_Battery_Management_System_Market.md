 Distributed management system (BMU + multiple CSC mode): This is to separate the functions of the battery module (module and CSC one-to-one mode), and the whole system forms a CSC (single management unit), BMU (battery Management controller), S-Box relay controller and vehicle controller, in the form of three layers and two networks. Typical applications are German I3, I8, E-Golf and Japanese IMIEV, Outlander and Model S. The advantage is that the module assembly process can be simplified, the sampling harness is relatively easy to fix, the distance between the harnesses is uniform, and there is no problem of uneven voltage drop; as analyzed later, when the battery pack is large, this mode is very advantageous up. The disadvantage is that the cost is high. As shown in 3, an additional MCU is required. The independent CAN bus supports the integration of information of each module and sends it to the BMS. The voltage information alignment design of the bus is also relatively complicated. This solution has the highest system cost, but it is the most convenient to transplant. It is a typical example of high unit price and low development cost. The battery pack can be large or small.</p><p>
