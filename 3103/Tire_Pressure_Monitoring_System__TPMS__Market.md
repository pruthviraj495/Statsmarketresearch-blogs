<h1>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>TPMS is an electronic system, designed to provide real-time information about tire pressure by monitoring the air pressure inside the tires. TPMS warns the driver about the number of underinflated tires. TPMS is classified into two categories: direct TPMS and indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS provides real-time information of the tire pressure using pressure monitoring sensors in the tires. As a result, automotive manufacturers are shifting their focus on the usage of direct TPMS sensors to improve the safety of the consumers.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).
