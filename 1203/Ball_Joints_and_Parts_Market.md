 <p>Although, ball joints have long service life, loss of lubricant or contamination due to seal failure leads to suspension system and steering failure. This further leads to misalignment and handling, which has led manufacturers to develop efficient systems catering to the problem. One of the challenges faced by overall steering system manufacturers is introduction of premium line products as compared to economy products. Since, ball joints are expensive as compared to tie rods, the ball joints and parts market is expected to record considerable revenue growth in the near future. The revenue growth is mainly attributed to shipment growth of ball joints and parts across the globe. Imports of ball joints and parts in Asian countries is a challenge for existing as well as new players entering the ball joints and parts market. Moreover, the market is witnessing consolidation at distributor level, which is anticipated to lead to fluctuating prices. This is further expected to expedite growth of low-priced economy-line parts and thus, a significant change in total market share of premium brands.</p>
