<h1>Automatic License Plate Recognition Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>This report studies the Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) market.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR; see also other names below) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. It can use existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, or cameras specifically designed for the task. ANPR is used by police forces around the world for law enforcement purposes, including to check if a vehicle is registered or licensed. It is also used for electronic toll collection on pay-per-use roads and as a method of cataloguing the movements of traffic, for example by highways agencies.</p>
