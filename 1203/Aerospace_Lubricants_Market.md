 <p>Aerospace lubricants are used to reduce the friction between the components of aerospace that are in direct contact in order to prevent wear and tear. Other purposes of aerospace lubricants include cooling of parts, providing anti-corrosion and rust-free properties, sealing in the gaps, etc. Lubricants are responsible for the smooth running of parts and components, which further results in better fuel economy and engine efficiency. Aerospace lubricants are prepared to withstand extreme pressure and temperature. These lubricants are used in various aerospace parts, such as auxiliary drive spine shaft, fan motor, control valves, bearings, seals, liquid fuelled turbines, reduction gears and wing flap actuators, among others. Aerospace lubricants are also used in space suits to seal the valves and connectors of the oxygen breathing system. Deep space flights use a special type of aerospace lubricant, which demands high reliability and long duration of lubrication for critical parts in order to operate smoothly without creating any disturbances during the exposure to high temperature or vacuum.</p>
