<h1>Railway Fishplate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>In rail terminology, a fishplate, splice bar or joint bar is a metal bar that is bolted to the ends of two rails to join them together in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship&#39;s mast.The top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the device wedges itself between the top and bottom of the rail when it is bolted into place.In rail transport modelling, a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.</p>
