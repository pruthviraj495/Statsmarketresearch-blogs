<h1>Automotive Linear Positions Sensors Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>Linear position sensors are linear variable differential transformers that are used in a variety of applications, including electronic devices, to measure and sense linear displacement. The collected data is then transformed into an analogue or digital signal. A motion controller or a digital readout can then decipher the position. Motion can be determined by tracking changes in the device&#39;s position over time. In industrial applications such as machine tools, material handling, test equipment, and motion systems, linear position sensors are widely used.</p>
