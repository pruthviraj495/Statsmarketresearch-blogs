<h1>Piston Connecting Rod Unit Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>The piston connecting rod changes the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotational motion of the crankshaft, and simultaneously converts the force acting on the piston into the external output torque of the crankshaft to drive the rotation of the automobile wheel. It is the transmission of the engine that transmits the pressure of the combustion gases to the crankshaft, rotating the crankshaft and outputting power. The piston connecting rod set is mainly composed of a piston, a piston ring, a piston pin, a connecting rod and a connecting rod bearing bush.</p>
