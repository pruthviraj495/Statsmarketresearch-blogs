 <p>Tubeless tires operate without an inner tube, while the outer casing makes an air tight seal with the rim of the wheel, and air is held in the assembly of casing and rim. The tubeless tire comprises of tread, steel belt, and spiral layer, and assist vehicles in numerous functions, such as supports vehicle load, transmits traction & breaking force to road surface, absorbs road shocks, and changes & maintains direction of travel. Moreover, to accomplish these basic functions, a tubeless tire is made up of steel belt covered with resilient rubber and inflated with high-pressure air (nitrogen, CO2, O2, and mixture of gases).</p>
