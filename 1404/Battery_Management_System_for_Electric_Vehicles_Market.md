<h1>Battery Management System for Electric Vehicles Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2035</h1><br/><p>Batteries such as lead-acid and lithium-ion have been widely used in electric vehicles as energy storage source due to their high-power density and long lifespan. A battery management system (BMS) is used in vehicles to monitor and regulate overall performance of batteries in operations. The battery management system is comprised of several components, such as battery monitoring integrated circuit (BMIC), cell management controller (CMC), battery management controllers (BMC), and intelligent controllers or embedded processors placed at strategic locations in the architecture to manage various aspects of the power system. A BMC provides voltage information by monitoring multiple battery cells. Furthermore, a BMC calculates state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery, which is used to determine the charge remaining in the battery and another calculation, including state-of-health (SOH), which provides essential insights on operating conditions of the battery.</p>
