<h1>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) are the systems that do not have air pressure sensors inside the tires. Rather, they detect a low tire by comparing relative wheel speeds via the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) wheel speed sensors. When a tire loses air, its diameter decreases slightly.</p>
