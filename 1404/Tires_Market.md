 <p>Tire is in a variety of vehicles or machinery assembled on the ground rolling ring elastic rubber products. Usually mounted on metal rims, it can support the body, cushion the external impact, achieve contact with the road and ensure the vehicle performance. Tires are often used under complex and harsh conditions. They bear various deformation, load, force and high and low temperature when driving, so they must have higher bearing capacity, traction capacity and buffer capacity. At the same time, it also requires high wear resistance and flexural resistance, as well as low rolling resistance and thermogenesis. Half of the world&#39;s rubber consumption in tire production, tire consumption capacity can be seen.</p>
