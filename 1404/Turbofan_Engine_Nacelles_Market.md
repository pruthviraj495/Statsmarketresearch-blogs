<h1>Turbofan Engine Nacelles Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A nacelle is a housing, separate from the fuselage, that holds engines, fuel, or equipment on an aircraft. In some cases?for instance in the typical "Farman" type "pusher" aircraft, or the World War II-era P-38 Lightning?an aircraft&#39;s cockpit may also be housed in a nacelle, which essentially fills the function of a conventional fuselage. The covering is typically aerodynamically shaped.</p>
