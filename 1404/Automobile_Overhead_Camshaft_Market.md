<h1>Automobile Overhead Camshaft Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>It is a popular valve mechanism of automobile engine nowadays. In this structure, the camshaft is placed in the cylinder head and above the combustion chamber, which directly drives the rocker arm and valve without passing through a longer push rod. Compared with the push-rod engine with the same number of valves (i.e. the top valve structure), the components requiring reciprocating motion in the top camshaft structure are much less, which greatly simplifies the valve distribution structure, significantly reduces the weight of the engine, and also improves the transmission efficiency and reduces the working noise.</p>
