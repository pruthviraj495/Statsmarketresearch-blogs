<h1>Autonomous Emergency Braking System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS) is a new safety technology increasingly being fitted to vehicles, which monitors the traffic conditions ahead and automatically brakes the car if the driver fails to respond to an emergency situation. AEB is seen by experts as an important development as is the seatbelt, but rather than protecting the occupant in the event of a crash, it aims to prevent the crash happening in the first place. The application of autonomous emergency braking system industry is engaged in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS).</p>
