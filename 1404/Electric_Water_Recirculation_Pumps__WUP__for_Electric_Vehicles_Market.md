<h1>Electric Water Recirculation Pumps (WUP) for Electric Vehicles Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Electric Water Recirculation Pumps (WUP) is installed into HEV, EV or FCV in order to cool down the surrounding devices of these vehicles. Conventional mechanical water pump is powered by combustion engine to circulate coolant around the engine. Volume of coolant is in proportion to the engine revolution. Just control of coolant volume on demand is not mechanically possible. It may either overcool or undercool. Electric water pump is activated by battery and motor only on demand for cooling. The function minimizes the load on engine</p>
