<h1>Off-Road Vehicle HID Lamps Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>A off-road vehicle HID is an arc lamp, so there is no heated precision filament. Instead, light is generated by an electric arc between two tungsten electrodes housed inside the arc tube. The translucent tube is filled with gas and metal salt. The gas assists in the initial ignition of the arc. Once the arc starts, it heats and vaporizes the metal salts that form the plasma, which greatly increases the intensity of light produced by the arc. HID lamps cannot operate directly on low voltage DC current. They need an igniter and ballast to boost the voltage. Most modern HID lights have the igniter and ballast built into the housing, but some off-road HID lights have an externally mounted igniter and ballast, which complicates installation.</p>
