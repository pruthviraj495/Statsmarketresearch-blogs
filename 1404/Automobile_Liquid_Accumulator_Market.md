<h1>Automobile Liquid Accumulator Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>The Liquid Accumulator is installed between the condenser and the volatilizer, close to the condenser. It is used to store liquid refrigerant and absorb water from the refrigerant. It is also called a high-pressure reservoir or a general reservoir.The Liquid Accumulator is divided into upper and lower compartments, mainly using water absorption media. The upper part of the Liquid Accumulator flows into the pressurized refrigerant, and only the liquid flows into the evaporator through the lower drain pipe. In this process, the Liquid Accumulator will remove both water and steam bubbles. In addition, the upper part of the Liquid Accumulator is equipped with Clutch Cycling Pressure S/W, and the lower part is equipped with filters.</p>
