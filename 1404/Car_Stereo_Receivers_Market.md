<h1>Car Radar Detectors Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A radar detector is an electronic device used by motorists to detect if their speed is being monitored by police or law enforcement using a radar gun. Most radar detectors are used so the driver can reduce the car&#39;s speed before being ticketed for speeding. In general sense, only emitting technologies, like doppler RADAR, or LIDAR can be detected. Visual speed estimating techniques, like ANPR or VASCAR can not be detected in daytime, but technically vulnerable to detection at night, when IR spotlight is used. There are no reports that piezo sensors can be detected. LIDAR devices require an optical-band sensor, although many modern detectors include LIDAR sensors. Most of today&#39;s radar detectors detect signals across a variety of wavelength bands: usually X, K, and Ka. In Europe the Ku band is common as well. The past success of radar detectors was based on the fact that radio-wave beam can not be narrow-enough, so the detector usually senses stray and scattered radiation, giving the driver time to slow down. Based on focused laser-beam, LIDAR technology is deprived of this shortcoming; however requires precise aiming. Modern police radars incorporate formidable computing power, producing minimum of ultra-short pulses, reusing wide beam for multi-target measurement[1], which renders most detectors useless. But, mobile Internet allowed for GPS navigation devices mapping police radar spots in real-time. These gadgets are also often called "radar detectors", while not necessary carrying an RF sensor.</p>
