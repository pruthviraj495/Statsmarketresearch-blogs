 <p>Global top five Automotive In-Vehicle Air Purifier companies in 2022 (%)</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Automotive In-Vehicle Air Purifier market was valued at US$ 1609.3 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 2289.9 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.2% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The automobile industry is dynamic in nature, and it continuously adopts advanced technologies for enhancing the customer experience. Interior cabin space of automobiles has evolved rapidly in terms of upholstery, automation of seats, and infotainment. This cabin space faces the most challenging environment as it is prone to polluted air, smoke, toxic fumes, bad odor, food smell, and pollens, which either get absorbed to the upholstery or float the air, making passengers prone to diseases. Globally, major cities are prone to smog and high pollutant concentrations owing to traffic congestion and increased emissions, which gives rise to the need for installation of onboard air purifiers or ionizers to purify the cabin air from harmful toxicants. Demand for clean & toxin-free cabin air and increase in air pollution level worldwide are the key drivers of automotive in-vehicle air purifiers. However, non-standardized products act as a major restraint to this growth.</p>
