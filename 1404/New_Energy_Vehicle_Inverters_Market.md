<h1>New Energy Vehicle Inverters Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>In the new energy drive system, the inverter controls the motor. This is a key component in a car, similar to the engine management system (EMS) of an internal combustion engine car, that determines driving behavior. The inverter not only drives the electric motor, but also captures the energy released through regenerative braking and feeds it back to the battery. Therefore, the range of the vehicle is directly related to the efficiency of the traction inverter. The new energy vehicle inverter is a key component of the torque vectoring drive unit.</p>
