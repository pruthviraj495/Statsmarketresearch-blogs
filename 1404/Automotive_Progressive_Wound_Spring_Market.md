<h1>Automotive Progressive Wound Spring Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2032</h1><br/><p>Progressive springs have an unequal spacing between each coil along their length. With the compression of the spring, the spring rate will change gradually. As compression increases, progressive springs stiffen quickly. Progressive springs provide a smooth ride over minor bumps while remaining firm when hit hard, such as by a pothole or a sharp bend. Progressive springs provide a good blend of smooth ride and robust handling for street cars.</p>
