<h1>High Output Ignition Coil Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>High Output Coils Are Used In Engines With Very High Compression Ratios. The Higher The Compression Ratio Of The Engine, The More Difficult It Is For The Spark Plug To Catch Fire. This Is Called Ignition Spark Saturation. High-Performance Ignition Coils Can Help Improve Engine Performance In Four Important Ways. First, The Higher Voltage Allows For A Larger Spark Plug Gap, Resulting In A Stronger Initial Flame Angle At The Beginning Of Combustion. The Result Is An Increase In Actual Engine Torque. Second, The Voltage On The Tap Is Higher, Which Means That The Voltage Required To Bridge The Spark Plug Gap Will Get There Faster, Reducing The Voltage Transfer Time Through The Inevitable Carbon Deposition Of The Spark Plug. Third, A Higher Electric Potential Will Produce A Stronger "Push Force" In The Current Flowing To The Plug, Resulting In An Increase In Current, That Is, More Energy And Faster Discharge. Fourth, As The Available Voltage Increases, There Will Be More Reserves Under Non-Standard Conditions</p>
