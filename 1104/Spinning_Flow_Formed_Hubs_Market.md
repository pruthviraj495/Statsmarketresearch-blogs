<h1>Spinning Flow Formed Hubs Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030</h1><br/><p>Spinning technology is a new type of solid-state forming technology, which refers to a method of rolling and forming under the action of external force. Wheel blanks are usually completed in combination with casting or forging techniques. At present, the use of spinning technology to produce aluminum alloy wheels mainly includes casting spinning and forging spinning: casting spinning refers to the use of spinning technology to shape the rim after casting into a billet. Wheels produced by casting technology have the characteristics of better performance and lighter weight; the forging spinning method is to use the spinning process to shape the rim after forging blanks to obtain a blank shape that cannot be achieved by forging, which is suitable for large-scale, lightweight Quantify the production of aluminum alloy wheels. The application of spinning technology makes the product performance and quality of aluminum alloy wheels reach a higher level.</p>
