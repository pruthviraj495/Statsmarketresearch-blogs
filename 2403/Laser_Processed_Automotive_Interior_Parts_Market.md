 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Laser processing technology is increasingly used in the automotive interiors industry for its high precision, high speed, high flexibility and perfect processing effect. The laser is in many ways an ideal tool for automotive interior applications. It is a non-contact method that produces no stress on the processed part, and requires virtually no downtime for tool replacement. In contrast, mechanical cutting is limited by tool wear and downtime for tool replacement, and waterjet cutting is limited by its slower throughput. Laser processing also allows the production of smaller features and delivers tighter tolerances than alternative technologies such as mechanical cutters. Another advantage of lasers is their ability to deliver defined depth cuts (blind holes or slits that only penetrate part of the way through the workpiece).</p>
