 <p>Automotive Hall sensors are devices that are used in the automotive industry to measure the position, speed, and direction of various components in a vehicle, such as the crankshaft, camshaft, and wheel speed sensors. They work on the principle of the Hall Effect, which is the production of a voltage difference (Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current.</p>
