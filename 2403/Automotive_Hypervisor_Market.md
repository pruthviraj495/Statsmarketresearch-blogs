 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>Hypervisor is a well known hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple virtual machines called guests identified by their OS to run on a host system. The virtual guests have access (exclusive or shared) to underlying hardware resources including CPU, memory and peripherals. In the context of the virtual guest, it appears as if all of the allocated hardware is natively available exclusively to that machine. Hypervisor in most cases also provides a means of controlling the execution state of the virtual guests. Hypervisors are increasingly being used in modern automotive software systems for combining safety critical and safety agnostic platforms as well as for consolidating multiple ECU functions into one.</p>
