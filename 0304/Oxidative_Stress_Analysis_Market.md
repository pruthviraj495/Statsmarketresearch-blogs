<h1>Oxidative Stress Analysis Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Oxidative stress refers to a state where the oxidative and antioxidant effects in the body are unbalanced, resulting in inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils and increased secretion of proteases, thereby producing a large number of oxidative intermediates. Oxidative stress is a negative effect produced by free radicals in the body and is considered to be an important factor in aging and disease. The oxidative stress analysis methods are roughly divided into three categories: 1) determination of compounds modified with active oxygen; 2) determination of the amount of active oxygen elimination system enzymes and antioxidant substances; 3) determination of oxidative stress indicators containing transcription factors.</p>
