<h1>Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) Car Batteries Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>AGM batteries differ from flooded lead acid batteries in that the electrolyte is held in the glass mats, as opposed to freely flooding the plates. Very thin glass fibers are woven into a mat to increase surface area enough to hold sufficient electrolyte on the cells for their lifetime. The fibers that compose the fine glass mat do not absorb nor are they affected by the acidic electrolyte. These mats are wrung out 2?5% after being soaked in acids, prior to manufacture completion and sealing.</p>
