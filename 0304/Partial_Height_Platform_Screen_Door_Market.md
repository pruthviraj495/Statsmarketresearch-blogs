<h1>Partial-Height Platform Screen Door Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p><p>
 
 Partial-height platform screen doors (PSDs) are safety barriers installed along railway platforms to prevent passengers from accidentally falling onto the tracks. Unlike full-height PSDs, which extend from the platform floor to the ceiling, partial-height PSDs typically cover only a portion of the platform's height, leaving the upper section open. Partial-height PSDs are often composed of transparent or opaque panels made of materials such as glass, polycarbonate, or metal, allowing passengers to see through them while providing protection from the platform edge. These doors are equipped with sensors and safety mechanisms to automatically open and close in synchronization with train arrivals and departures. Partial-height PSDs enhance passenger safety by reducing the risk of accidents, minimizing the spread of debris, and improving air circulation on platforms. They are commonly used in metro systems, subway stations, and other urban rail transit networks to enhance station safety and passenger flow while maintaining aesthetic and architectural considerations.</p><p>
