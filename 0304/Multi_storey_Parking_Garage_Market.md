<h1>Multi-storey Parking Garage Market Professional Survey, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Multi-storey car parks, also called automated (car) parking system (APS), is a mechanical system designed to minimize the area and/or volume required for parking cars. Like a multi-story parking garage, an APS provides parking for cars on multiple levels stacked vertically to maximize the number of parking spaces while minimizing land usage. The APS, however, utilizes a mechanical system to transport cars to and from parking spaces (rather than the driver) in order to eliminate much of the space wasted in a multi-story parking garage. While a multi-story parking garage is similar to multiple parking lots stacked vertically, an APS is more similar to an automated storage and retrieval system for cars.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Multi-storey Parking Garage, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Multi-storey Parking Garage.
