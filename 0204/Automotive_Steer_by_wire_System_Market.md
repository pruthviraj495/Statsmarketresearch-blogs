 <p>Vehicle steer-by-wire refers to a system that uses cables and wiring to electronically perform steering operations in a vehicle. In such a setup, there is no longer any mechanical connection between the input component for steering (e.g. the steering wheel) and the vehicle?s wheels. Instead, all steering commands are transmitted electrically by a control unit to a motor that then executes the steering movement, thereby causing the wheels to turn in a corresponding manner.</p>
