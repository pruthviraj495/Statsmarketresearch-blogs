<h1>Vehicle-mounted Millimeter Wave Radar Systems Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Vehicle-mounted millimeter-wave radar systems are sophisticated radar technologies used in automotive applications to detect objects in a vehicle&#39;s environment. Utilizing short-wavelength electromagnetic waves, these systems are essential for providing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle capabilities. The technology works by emitting millimeter-wave signals that reflect off surrounding objects, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles, enabling the radar to compute the distance, speed, and angle of these objects. These systems are instrumental in improving safety and driving performance, especially in applications like adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, and parking assistance.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The radar systems operate primarily in the 24GHz and 77GHz frequency ranges, with each offering specific benefits in terms of resolution, range, and energy consumption. They provide real-time data that enhances a vehicle&#39;s awareness of its surroundings, which is crucial for both semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. By employing high-resolution sensors, these radar systems improve the precision of vehicle navigation and the detection of hard-to-spot objects.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global vehicle-mounted millimeter-wave radar systems market was valued at USD 439 million in 2024 and is forecasted to grow to USD 658.55? million by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.20% over the forecast period.</strong></p>
