<h1>Miniature Voltage Transformer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>The miniature voltage transformer is a current-type voltage transformer. The primary resistor is connected in series through the circuit, and the secondary resistor is connected in parallel. The voltage is converted into current, and after the current conversion is performed by the transformer, the primary output current signal is converted into the required voltage through the sampling resistor. Most of the miniature voltage transformers are used in the circuit board.</p>
