<h1>Automotive Engine Camshaft Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Camshaft is an important engine component in an automobile, from a technical standpoint, a Vehicle Camshaft fulfills the function of converting rotatory motion of crankshaft to oscillating motion of follower, through a cam profile. The camshaft uses lobes (called cams) that push against the valves to open them as the camshaft rotates; springs on the valves return them to their closed position. This is a critical job, and can have a great impact on an engine&#39;s performance at different speeds</p>
