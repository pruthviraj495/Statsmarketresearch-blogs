<h1>Semi-submersible Vessel Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Semi-submersible heavy-lift ships have a long and low well deck between a forward pilot house and an?aft?machinery space. In superficial appearance, it is somewhat similar to a dry?bulk carrier?or some forms of?oil tanker. Its?ballast tanks?can be flooded to lower the well deck below the water&#39;s surface, allowing?oil platforms, other vessels, or other floating cargo to be moved into position for loading (float-on/float-off). The tanks are then pumped out, and the well deck rises to shoulder the load. To balance the cargo, the various tanks can be pumped unevenly.</p>
