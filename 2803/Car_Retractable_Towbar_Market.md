<h1>Car Retractable Towbar Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>A retractable towbar is a towbar solution that can easily be folded out of sight if you are not using it.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>A retractable towbar can be easily folded away under the bumper when it is not in use. Offering the same advantages as a detachable towbar, the simple precision rotation mechanism means that a retractable towbar takes seconds to hide away or prepare for use. This type of towbar can be wired into your vehicle?s electrical system. A retractable towbar can tow trailers, caravans and boats and is also compatible with a majority of cycle carriers. With a swan-shaped neck, the tow ball doesn?t need to be stored separately when folded away, as this too is concealed underneath the bumper.</p>
