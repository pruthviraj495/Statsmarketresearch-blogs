<h1>Lockable Automotive Gas Spring Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p>Adjustable locking gas springs allow the piston rod to be locked at any position in its stroke. The process is initiated by triggering a plunger that is linked to the piston rod. Upon pressing the plunger, the rod starts working as a compression gas spring. The rod gets locked in a position, when the plunger is released at any point in the stroke. Locking gas springs consist of components, such as piston rod, piston valve, cylinder, guide, seals, etc.</p>
