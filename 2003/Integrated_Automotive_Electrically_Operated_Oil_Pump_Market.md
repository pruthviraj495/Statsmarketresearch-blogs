 <p>The electric vehicle insulation monitor can be used for real-time online monitoring of the power system of electric vehicles. It adopts the low-frequency signal injection method for testing, and has the characteristics of high detection internal resistance and wide detection range. It is suitable for electric vehicle manufacturers, electric vehicle driver manufacturers and maintenance engineers. The working principle of insulation monitoring mainly includes current sensing method, symmetrical voltage measurement method, bridge resistance method, low frequency signal injection method, etc. The low-frequency signal injection method is the most widely used. A positive and negative square wave signal is generated inside it, and the insulation resistance RF between the connection terminal of the insulation impedance monitor and the DC high voltage system and chassis forms a measuring circuit. The RF size is calculated by collecting the partial voltage on the sampling resistance. The electric vehicle insulation monitor is used to detect the electrical insulation performance of the high-voltage system of the electric vehicle to the vehicle in real time, and ensure that the vehicle operates under the insulation state, which is of great significance to ensure the personal safety of passengers, the normal operation of electrical equipment and the safe operation of the vehicle.</p>
