 <p>The function of the electric gasoline pump is to supply the fuel required by each fuel injector and cold start fuel injector. It is mainly used for cooling and lubrication of new energy oil-cooled drive motors and hybrid gearboxes. There are usually two types of electric gasoline pump used in the electronically controlled gasoline injection system, namely, roller type electric gasoline pump and vane type electric gasoline pump. One end of the pump housing is the oil inlet and the other end is the oil outlet. The roller pump on the oil inlet side is driven at high speed by the drive motor in the middle of the pump housing.</p>
